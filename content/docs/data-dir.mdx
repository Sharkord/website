Sharkord stores its data in a directory. This includes configuration files, logs, and other runtime data. The location of this directory depends on your operating system.

### Linux

`~/.local/share/sharkord`

### Windows

`%APPDATA%\sharkord`

### macOS

`~/Library/Application Support/sharkord`

### Docker

When running Sharkord in a Docker container, the data directory is typically mounted as a volume or bind mount. You can specify the location of the data directory on your host machine when starting the container.

## Migrating Your Server

To migrate your Sharkord server to a new machine or location, simply copy the entire data directory to the new location. This will preserve all your settings, logs, and other data.
