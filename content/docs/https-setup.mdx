# HTTPS Setup

Sharkord does not currently include built-in HTTPS support.

To serve Sharkord securely, place it behind a reverse proxy such as Nginx or Caddy and terminate TLS there.

This setup handles SSL certificates and encrypted traffic while Sharkord continues serving application traffic behind the proxy.
