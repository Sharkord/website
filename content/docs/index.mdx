# Sharkord

Sharkord is a self-hosted communication platform that brings core Discord-like features to your own infrastructure: voice channels, text chat, and file sharing with full control over your data.

> [!NOTE]
> Sharkord is currently in alpha. Bugs, incomplete features, and breaking changes are expected.

## Why Sharkord?

- Self-hosted and privacy-first.
- No third-party lock-in.
- Voice, text, and file sharing in one platform.
- Runs as a standalone binary on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Live Demo
