To run Sharkord using Docker, use the following command:

```bash
docker run \
  -p 4991:4991/tcp \
  -p 40000:40000/tcp \
  -p 40000:40000/udp \
  -v ./data:/root/.config/sharkord \
  --name sharkord \
  sharkord/sharkord:latest
```

Note that it needs to bind the following ports:

- `4991`: TCP only for the communication between the client and the server.
- `40000`: Both TCP and UDP to handle streaming and voice communication.

Then open `http://localhost:4991` in your web browser to access the Sharkord web interface.
