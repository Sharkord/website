Run Sharkord in Docker with HTTP and RTC ports mapped:

```bash
docker run \
  -p 4991:4991/tcp \
  -p 40000-40020:40000-40020/tcp \
  -p 40000-40020:40000-40020/udp \
  -v ./data:/root/.config/sharkord \
  --name sharkord \
  sharkord/sharkord:latest
```

Then open `http://localhost:4991`.

See [HTTPS Setup](/docs/https/caddy) guide for securing your Sharkord instance with HTTPS, which is required for streaming features.
