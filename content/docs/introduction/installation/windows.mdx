<Alert title="Windows Support" type="warning">
  Sharkord is primarily developed and tested on Linux. At the moment, the
  Windows build has some problems, specially with voice chats. We recommend the
  use of the Docker version OR running Sharkord on WSL2.
</Alert>

# Windows Installation

1. Download `sharkord-windows-x64.exe` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/sharkord/sharkord/releases/latest).
2. Open Command Prompt and navigate to the folder where you downloaded the executable.
3. Run:

```powershell
.\sharkord-windows-x64.exe
```

## Required Runtime

Install Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2022 Redistributable (x64):

[https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)

Without this dependency, Sharkord will fail to start.
