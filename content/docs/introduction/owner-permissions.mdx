To gain owner permissions, you will need the owner access token generated on first launch.

To assign owner role to your account:

1. Log in to your Sharkord server.
2. Open browser dev tools (`CTRL + Shift + I` or right-click and select Inspect).
3. Open the console tab.
4. Run `useToken("your_token_here")` with your generated token.
5. Press Enter.

Your account now has owner permissions.
