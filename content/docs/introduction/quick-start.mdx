# Quick Start

Sharkord ships as a standalone binary that includes both server and client.

1. Download the latest release for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/sharkord/sharkord/releases).
2. Run Sharkord ([Linux](/docs/introduction/installation/linux), [Windows](/docs/introduction/installation/windows), [macOS](/docs/introduction/installation/macos)).
3. Open `http://localhost:4991` in your browser.

## First Launch

On first launch, Sharkord generates an owner access token and prints it in the server console.

Treat this token like a master password; anyone with it can gain owner permissions.

See [Gain Owner Permissions](/docs/introduction/owner-permissions) for the current flow.
