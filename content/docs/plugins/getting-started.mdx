This guide walks through creating a minimal Sharkord plugin.

### 1) Create a Plugin Directory

Initialize a new plugin:

```bash
bun create github.com/Sharkord/plugin-example
```

### 2) Link the SDK & UI (if building components)

To do this, first clone the Sharkord repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sharkord/sharkord.git
```

Install dependencies and link the correct packages:

```bash
cd sharkord

bun install

cd ./packages/plugin-sdk
bun link

cd ../ui
bun link
```

Then, in your plugin directory, link the SDK and UI:

```bash
cd plugin-example

bun link @sharkord/plugin-sdk
bun link @sharkord/ui
```

### 3) Change the Plugin Manifest

Go to `package.json` and edit the information to match your plugin:

### 4) Build

Your plugin needs to be bundled before it can be used. Two scripts are pre-shipped in the `package.json`:

- `build`: Bundles the plugin for production.
- `build:dev`: Bundles the plugin AND copies to the sharkord plugins directory for testing.

These two commands need to be edited to match the correct paths in your system.
