Sharkord plugins let you extend server behavior with custom logic such as automations, integrations, and commands.

<Alert type="warning">
  Plugins are an experimental feature and may have breaking changes.

### Security Model

Plugins execute with host-level access and should be treated as privileged code. Only install plugins from trusted sources, and consider running Sharkord in Docker for better isolation when using plugins.

### Plugin SDK

Use the official SDK for type-safe plugin development: [packages/plugin-sdk](https://github.com/Sharkord/sharkord/tree/development/packages/plugin-sdk).
