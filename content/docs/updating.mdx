To update Sharkord, you have multiple options:

- **Via the Admin panel**: You can trigger an update from there. This will download and install the latest version of Sharkord. Not available in Docker.
- **Manual update**: You can also manually download the latest release from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/sharkord/sharkord/releases) and simply run the new version. Your existing configuration and data will be preserved.
- **Docker**: If you're running Sharkord in a Docker container, you can pull the latest image from Docker Hub and restart your container to update to the latest version.

### Automatic Updates

Sharkord can automatically check for updates and install them. To enable this feature, set the `autoupdate` option to `true` in your `config.ini` file. Note that automatic updates are not available when running Sharkord in a Docker container.

<Alert type="warning" title="Attention">
  Triggering the update from the Admin panel OR relying the automatic update may
  not work in some environments. For now, it's recommended to update manually by
  downloading the latest release from GitHub or pulling the latest Docker image.
